[{"about":"The iconic SL has been transformed from 'super-light' to 'superb luxurious', and in SL55 form, packs plenty of firepower, too. Electric cars, EVs, zero emissions, sustainability, eco-friendliness. We're constantly bombarded with terms like these that we're literally drowning in eco-consciousness. Internal combustion engines and fossil fuels are bad and must be phased out. The intentions are good, but they are becoming suffocating. Ever-tightening emission regulations have quietened the voices of high-performance machines. Driving and admiring 'traditional' sports cars feels like a crime. But every now and then, a car like the Mercedes-Benz SL comes along. Yes, it goes fast, attracts attention, and takes a big chunk out of your savings. In SL55 form, it is the first brand-new SL in Singapore that costs over $1 million ($1,002,888 to be exact), its price inflated by the heftier taxes levied on super-luxury cars. Price tag and vehicle dynamics are just the tip of the iceberg, though. It is no ordinary sports car, for the SL's true purpose is to refresh a petrolhead's soul."},
{"pedigree":"When one thinks of a German sports car with heritage, chances are the Porsche 911 , which was first launched in 1963, immediately pops into mind. There's another model with an even longer history though: It's the Mercedes-Benz SL, which first debuted as a racecar in 1952. The SL has racecar heritage, but over seven decades, its sportiness was blended with cruising ability. SL, which stands for 'sport-light', continually evolved into a topless grand tourer."}]
